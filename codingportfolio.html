			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>My website is actually a website starting from today (June 12, 2018)! I struggled with adding content on my site. At the end I decided to just a bunch of marine animals stuff because I have a lot of information about marine animals. I decided to change my index to the about page because it was pretty random and it fit way better in the about page. So the index is still empty. I feel like I really got the hang of using HTML.</p>	
			<h2>Social Sercurity</h2>
			<p>SOCIAL SECURITY is a lot more complicated to do than what I intially thought. For starters we were working on the Caesar Cipher on javascript which became really difficult because we had to create a loop. In python create a loop was a little bit more easier. Although I didn't really get the hang of python, coding it for functions. We got the cipher to finally</p>
