<h4>Description</h4>

		<td>Like all jellyfishes, the lion’s mane jellyfish has radial symmetry and has its mouth under the bell. And unlike many jellyfish, bioluminescent is something a lion’s mane jellyfish can do. There is 4 different stages the lion’s mane jellyfish goes through while it is maturing: the larval stage, polyp stage, ephyrae stage, and then the medusa stage. It likes colder climates; they can be found in the arctic ocean, the northern atlantic and northern pacific ocean.</td>

		<td>Not many organisms feed on lion’s mane jellyfish: seabirds, large fish (like an ocean sunfish), other jellyfish, and most commonly sea turtles. Sea turtles are the main predators of the lion’s mane jellyfish. The way the jellyfish eats is it traps organisms in its tentacles and stings their prey while it slowly pulls it up to its mouth where it gets digested. They mainly feed on fish but they also eat other jellyfish and other sea creatures.</td>

<p>They can be dangerous to humans who are swimming near them. The sting from a lion’s mane jellyfish is rarely ever fatal. Usually there is only temporary pain and redness. Lion’s mane jellyfish do not hunt after humans.</p>
